Regular Expressions homework

In shell, \d and \w don't work. Can sub [[:digit:]] or [0-9] for \d
Also reads +, ?, {, }, |, (, and ) literally; for their special usage must escape with \
so [0-9]\+ matches a string of numbers of length 1 or longer
while [0-9]+ matches a string of a digit and +
Can bypass this by using egrep or grep -E to use extended regex rather than GNU
