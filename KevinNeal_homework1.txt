1. ls [A-Z]*
#lists files and descriptions of files in current folder, in alphabetical order
2. cp *.sh /tmp
#no such file or directory... but should copy all files that end with .sh to /tmp folder
3. man pwd
#brings up entry for "pwd" in the manual
4. cd ~
#moves to home directory
5. mkdir -p test1/test2/test3
#creates directories; -p allows missing parent directories to be created as needed
6. cp -r /tmp .
#copies all subdirectories and files from /tmp to current directory (.)
#but not really... seems it is copying /tmp from . and moving it to, uh, .
#however, doing e.g. cp -r /tmp/test . would copy the subdirectory /test into the current directory
7. ls | less
#pipes the contents of the current directory into a text viewer within the terminal
#press q to exit!
8. head -n 24 test.txt » abc.txt
#print the first 24 lines, sorted numerically, of test.txt and append them to file abc.txt
#will create abc.txt if doesn't already exist, otherwise puts the text at end of file
9. echo "aaa" > aaa.txt
#creates a file aaa.txt with the string "aaa" within
10. ps -u sallesina
#prints processes being run by a user named sallesina
11. top
#shows all tasks/processes being run by every user on the system
12. ls | grep .sh | xargs mv /tmp
#grep matches all files in current directory that contain .sh and moves
#them into /tmp, or should? but error: "mv: missing destination file operand after '/tmp'"
13. du -sk /home/* | sort -r -n | head -10
#du summarizes disk usage of directories in /home/; -sk (sum of directories in kilobytes)
#sorted reverse-numerically, and prints the first 10 lines???
14. sort -r names.txt
#reverse-sort lines in names.txt
